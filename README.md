Just another hello from another point of the world :-D


Hello there!

At the moment I'm learnig Swift and wanna get started with Github (Maybe I will use it later for some projects). After that I want to learn how to build web-pages and learn Java or JS (I have to look whats best for me). And finaly C# or C++. But that's a looong way to go. Nevertheless I'm confident about it.
